      Trees help maintain our environment’s clean air by producing oxygen, sequestering carbon, and filtering out pollutants. They also offer shelter from UV rays, reduce stormwater runoff, prevent erosion, and harvest fruits, nuts, and medicinal ingredients.

      Trees provide homes for more than 80% of Earth’s land-based animals, plants, and insects, and they play a big role in our drinking water, controlling our water’s quality, availability, and the cost of water treatment.

      Different climate stressors are putting the health of trees in danger. Bouts of droughts or intense rain, rising temperatures, changing season lengths, and extreme weather are all troubling them. These stressors change rapidly, and there isn’t much time for them to adapt.
