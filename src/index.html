      Trees provide homes for more than 80% of Earth’s land-based animals, plants, and insects, <i>and</i> they play a big role in our drinking water, controlling our water’s quality, availability, and the cost of water treatment.

      Different climate stressors are putting the health of trees in danger. Bouts of droughts or intense rain, rising temperatures, changing season lengths, and extreme weather are all troubling them. These stressors change rapidly, and there isn’t much time for them to adapt.
